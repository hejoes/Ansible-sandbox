# 🤖 Ansible Lab

This Terraform script automatically provisions an Ansible Sandbox environment in
AWS. It creates a custom VPC with multiple Ubuntu EC2 instances deployed on
public subnet and configures them as Ansible Slaves. The script generates all
necessary configuration files (`inventory` and `ansible.cfg`), allowing user to
start writing/experimenting with Ansible playbooks on local machine straight
away.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- SSH key pair generated. The script expects it to be present on
  `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- AWS credentials exported
- Ansible
- Terraform

## 🚀 Usage

### 📈 Scaling the Slaves

- To scale the Ansible slaves to your liking, modify the count and instance_type
  on `terraform.tfvars`.

### 🔌 Testing Connectivity

- After successful apply, you should be able to connect to all slaves:

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

- To verify SSH access:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<instance-public-ip>
```
